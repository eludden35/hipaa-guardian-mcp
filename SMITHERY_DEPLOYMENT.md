# Smithery.ai Deployment Guide for HIPAA Compliance Guardian MCP Server

This guide will help you deploy the HIPAA Compliance Guardian MCP Server on Smithery.ai.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Access to Smithery.ai platform
- Git repository with your MCP server code

## Step 1: Build the Server

First, build the server for production:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist/` directory with the compiled JavaScript and necessary files.

## Step 2: Prepare for Smithery Deployment

The server is now ready for Smithery deployment. The key files that will be deployed are:

- `dist/server.js` - The compiled MCP server
- `dist/hipaa-content.json` - The HIPAA knowledge base
- `dist/package.json` - Production dependencies
- `smithery.yaml` - Smithery configuration file (in the root directory)

## Step 3: Deploy to Smithery.ai

1. **Upload to Smithery.ai:**
   - Go to your Smithery.ai dashboard
   - Create a new MCP server deployment
   - Upload the contents of the `dist/` directory

2. **Configure the Server:**
   - The `smithery.yaml` file contains all the necessary configuration
   - Server Name: `hipaa-compliance-guardian`
   - Entry Point: `server.js`
   - Runtime: Node.js 18+

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - No environment variables are required for this server
   - The server runs in production mode by default

## Step 4: Test the Deployment

Once deployed, you can test the server by connecting to it through an MCP client. The server provides the following tools:

### Core HIPAA Tools:
- `evaluateComplianceNeed` - Determine if your app needs HIPAA compliance
- `getComplianceRoadmap` - Step-by-step compliance roadmap
- `getCoreDefinitions` - Key HIPAA term definitions
- `getSecurityRuleSafeguards` - Security rule implementation guide
- `getMobileSecurityControls` - Mobile app security checklist
- `getPenaltyInformation` - Current HIPAA violation penalties
- `getValidationAndAuditInfo` - Compliance validation information
- `getDeveloperConsiderations` - Developer-specific guidance

### Advanced Tools:
- `getBreachResponseChecklist` - Data breach response procedures
- `getSecureCodingChecklist` - Secure coding practices
- `getVendorVettingChecklist` - Third-party vendor evaluation
- `getApiSecurityChecklist` - API security best practices
- `getPrivacyPolicyPoints` - Privacy policy requirements
- `getGeneralDataSecurityChecklist` - General PII security
- `confirmCodeCompliance` - Code compliance validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Server won't start:**
   - Check that `hipaa-content.json` is in the same directory as `server.js`
   - Verify Node.js version is 18+

2. **Tools not working:**
   - Ensure the MCP client is properly configured
   - Check server logs for error messages

3. **Build errors:**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check TypeScript compilation errors

### Logs and Monitoring:

The server provides detailed logging:
- ‚úÖ Success messages for each operation
- ‚ùå Error messages with details
- üìã List of available tools on startup

## Security Considerations

This MCP server:
- Does not store any user data
- Provides read-only access to HIPAA guidance
- Does not require any API keys or sensitive configuration
- Is safe for deployment in any environment

## Support

For issues with the MCP server itself, check the server logs and ensure all files are properly deployed.

For Smithery.ai platform issues, refer to their official documentation and support channels.
